"公司为何分红"是公司金融领域的经典谜题。本文采用"机器学习预测+准自然实验因果推断"的双路径研究设计，从统计关联与因果识别两个层面系统探究驱动中国上市公司分红决策的关键因素及其对监管政策冲击的响应。第一路径以2006—2022年沪深A股上市公司为样本，运用随机森林和梯度提升树在一年期滚动预测框架下比较71个候选特征的预测贡献，结果表明集成学习模型的样本外预测能力显著优于传统线性方法（RF的R²为0.2510，GBDT为0.2368，OLS仅为0.1565）；特征重要性排序中，上一期股利水平、资产收益率和留存收益资产比稳定居于前三位，代理成本变量（其他应收款资产比等）进入重要性前十，累积局部效应图揭示了掏空程度对分红的非线性抑制效应，主成分分析从降维视角提供了互补验证，假设H1得到支持。第二路径以2023年《上市公司现金分红指引》修订为准自然实验，基于2020—2024年2,306家上市公司样本构建双向固定效应双重差分模型，发现政策使处理组企业的分红概率提高约8.3个百分点、股利支付率提高约10.8个百分点，均在1%水平上显著，该结论在平行趋势检验、安慰剂检验、PSM-DID、Hausman-Taylor估计、熵平衡匹配、排除替代解释和剔除再融资样本七项稳健性检验下保持稳定，假设H2得到支持；异质性分析发现高代理成本企业的政策效应显著更强（Bootstrap组间差异检验p<0.05），假设H3得到支持。本文的发现表明，生命周期与代理成本是理解中国上市公司分红行为的核心经济维度，"硬约束"分红监管对提升企业分红具有显著因果效应，且对代理问题突出的企业效果更为明显，建议监管部门持续完善分红监管机制并关注高代理成本企业的差异化治理。

# Abstract

"Why do firms pay dividends?" remains a classic puzzle in corporate finance. This paper adopts a dual-pathway research design combining machine learning prediction with quasi-natural experiment causal inference to systematically investigate the key determinants of dividend decisions among Chinese listed companies and their responses to regulatory policy shocks. The first pathway uses a sample of Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2006 to 2022, employing Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Trees within a one-year rolling prediction framework to compare the predictive contributions of 71 candidate features. Results show that ensemble learning models significantly outperform traditional linear methods in out-of-sample prediction (RF R² = 0.2510, GBDT R² = 0.2368, vs. OLS R² = 0.1565). In the feature importance ranking, lagged dividend level, return on assets, and the retained earnings-to-assets ratio consistently rank among the top three, while agency cost variables (e.g., other receivables-to-assets ratio) rank within the top ten. Accumulated Local Effects plots reveal a nonlinear suppressive effect of tunneling on dividends, and Principal Component Analysis provides complementary validation from a dimensionality reduction perspective, supporting Hypothesis H1. The second pathway treats the 2023 revision of the Guidelines on Cash Dividends of Listed Companies as a quasi-natural experiment. Using a 2020–2024 sample of 2,306 listed companies and a two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences model, the study finds that the policy increased the dividend probability of treated firms by approximately 8.3 percentage points and the dividend payout ratio by approximately 10.8 percentage points, both significant at the 1% level. These findings remain robust across seven sensitivity checks, including parallel trends tests, placebo tests, PSM-DID, Hausman-Taylor estimation, entropy balancing, exclusion of alternative explanations, and removal of refinancing-motivated samples, supporting Hypothesis H2. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the policy effect is significantly stronger for firms with higher agency costs (bootstrap between-group difference test p < 0.05), supporting Hypothesis H3. The findings indicate that life cycle stage and agency costs are the core economic dimensions for understanding dividend behavior of Chinese listed companies, that "hard-constraint" dividend regulation has a significant causal effect on enhancing corporate dividends, and that the effect is more pronounced for firms with severe agency problems. The paper recommends that regulators continue to improve dividend regulatory mechanisms and adopt differentiated governance for firms with high agency costs.
